## 📌 Task Objectives

- Load and preprocess a dataset
- Train a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluate the model using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision & Recall
  - ROC curve and AUC score

---

## 🧰 Libraries & Tools

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset
   - Handled categorical variables using encoding
   - Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`

2. **Model Training**
   - Used `LogisticRegressionCV` for cross-validated training

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculated accuracy, precision, and recall
   - Plotted the ROC curve and computed AUC
